## git_comment_counter.py
This is a script that allows you to get a count of all the coments per user on a repo. The script
goes PR by PR capturing the comments. Right now is single threaded, but we plan to add
multithreading in the future to make this faster. 

Change the parameters on the script itself to change repo or the PR range
